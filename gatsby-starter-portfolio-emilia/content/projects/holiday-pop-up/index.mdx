Every December the UC Botanical Garden transforms a building into mini holiday market with local vendor products and Garden offerings. Below is the branding for 2019 and 2018 Holiday Pop-Up Shops. In 2019 I was inspired to bring back <i>garden</i> as the focus of the branding with photography instead of an illustration. I put  the <i>holiday</i> aspect in the floral arrangement by choosing textured leaves and grains, pops of reds and purples, and subtle hints to winter changes of decay. I paired this with retro-feeling graphic elements of the pastel color palette and font choice so that when implementing the branding for advertising among a sea of other holiday advertising the non-traditional holiday elements will stick out but evoke a feeling of nostalgia and warmth. 
Both the 2018 and 2019 branding were implemented in social media campaigns, email campaigns, paid advertising, print flyers, and posters.
