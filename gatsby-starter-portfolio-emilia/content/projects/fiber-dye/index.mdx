Fiber & Dye is an interactive, ethnobotanical exhibit held every year at the UC Botanical Garden. In 2019, I redesigned the 20-year-old informational boards, working with the Programs Department, to breathe life back into the exhibit. A challenge with this revamp was to balance the rich interpretive text (the feature of the previous board design) with striking imagery to leave a lasting impression with visitors.
