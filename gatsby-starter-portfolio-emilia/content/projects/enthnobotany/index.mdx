2019 embarked upon the Year of Ethnobotany for the UC Botanical Garden. I initally struggled with visualizing the concept of ethnobotany: it is the way plants and people interact, how we use plants historically and in our daily lives, it is multifaceted and everywhere. The year culminated in an international sympsoium titled <i>Connecting Plants and People: an Ethnobotanical Conversation</i>. I took the idea of <i>connecting</i> and created a linear motif used throughout the year. I created program cards for the first three quarters with the line motif and botanical illustrations. The lines connected the illstrations which respresent plants with the text that is manmade and facilitated by people, while evoking a scientific feel. After ruminating on ethnobotany for half a year, I created the illustration used on the bottom of the symposium flyer tying together lecture topics from the symposium and throughout the year, representing things made from plants with the plants that make them, and the people who expertly create them pictured nearby.
