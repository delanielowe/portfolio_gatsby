The UC Botanical Garden publishes a yearly newsletter recapping the previous year and includes an annual report. The newsletter is 24 pages and is mailed with an annual appeal letter and remit envelope. I inherited the design template for the Fall 2018 issue, but made slight updates to modernize and include my own touch. I am particularly proud of my own photo being approved as the cover.
In the Fall 2019 issue, I worked hard to make it a more visual publication, carving out room for larger photos, spreads, and a striking annual report. Photos coming soon.
As with any highly collaborative project, actually designing the newsletter is the easiest part. I faced challenges balancing wishes of the content creators, vision from the editors, and my own design desires. Working through these challenges and learning to integrate feedback from multiple facets taught me valuable lessons in collaboration and truly made the end product stronger and more satisfying.
